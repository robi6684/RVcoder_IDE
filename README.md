# RVcoder_IDE
Hello Everyone, I am Ravi Kumar, a passionate Full Stack Developer. This is an online ide which supports 4 different languages (C, c++, Java, Python). For making this ide, I have used Monaco Editor which is used for developing editors like VS-Code. I have used Judge0 Rapid Api for generating a submission and fetching the results. This ide will produce correct output for well written codes. It can handle compilation errors as well as runtime errors and you will be able to identify the errors.

Since I am using free version of Judge0 Rapid Api, It will only allow 50 submissions per day. So if you are not getting any output, it means maximum daily submission reached. And if there is coming any random data in output, please reload or make another submission as there could be some problem from api side.

Try this ide and enjoy!
